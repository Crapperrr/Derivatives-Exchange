# Derivatives-Exchange
An exchange written in solidity and run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine through which users will be able to create their own markets and trade binary options on an underlying whose data is pulled from a provided API.

This is just in progress and any suggestions on how to lower gas costs or otherwise streamline the design would be greatly appriciated.
